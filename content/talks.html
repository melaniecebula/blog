  Here are some external talks I've given. Reach out if you'd like me to speak
  at your conference!
</p>

<h1> KubeCon NA 2018, keynote </h1>
<p>
  <b>Abstract:</b> You've already made the plunge to move to Kubernetes, and you feel pretty good about that. But why does it feel like it requires expert-level Kubernetes knowledge for engineers to get anything done? This talk will identify key problems that make out-of-the-box Kubernetes less friendly to developers, and strategies for addressing them, based on Airbnbâ€™s experience empowering one thousand engineers to develop hundreds of Kubernetes services at scale. This talk will focus primarily on four problem areas:
1. Configuration: Generated and templated configuration, extracting shareable components and containers
2. CI/CD: Containerizing CI/CD, validation, build and deploy strategies
3. Tooling: Creating and distributing a kubectl wrapper
